                <p>Hello! My name is Anees Adams and I am a student at UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp. I am originally from Raleigh, North Carolina and moved to Charlotte because of school. Having been in Charlotte for about four years, I have battled with what I actually want to do as a profession. I have been in school for almost my whole life and there have been a few things that have caught my attention. I started as a psychology major and after about a year of actually taking classes and looking in the job market, I found that it just was not for me. I then persued excercise science, which I stuck with for several years and just before my final year, I decided that again it was not something that I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. Throughout this entire process, I have worked multiple retail jobs. Most recently I was the stock manager at The North Face and I was quite happy. The change came about a year ago when my coworker started talking to me about coding and I quickly began to take interest. Fast foward to this year, I finally decided to take a leap of faith and exit the world of retail and escape my comfort zone to try and expand my knowledge and find the passion that was missing. My goal for this class is to use the skills that I have learned to make myself employer competitive and find a job within the tech industry.</p>
